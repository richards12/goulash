add a library: Fortran with no OpenMP offload. so that it can be compiled with ftn
  libblahblahblah.a || libmeh.h

Add options to enable or diable programming models, i.e. -DENABLE_LIBFLIB, ect.
  Have cmake be able to turn them on/off
  Also for make files  

Include BLT?

CMakeList files to build everythibg
  Each Library should have its own CMakeLists.txt
  FindXXX.cmake should be used to pull things

Spack packages for everything
  We can then programatically have a way to test many permutations of options and compilers

Name changes
  Project -> Graveyard
  Libraries and source files should also be changed to something sensible.  

Add MPI
  Allgather on a status flag || Allreduce with max operator
  Down the road maybe a halo exhange?
